# About the program

The analysis of the Russian digital market shows that specialists in machine learning and data analysis are particularly in demand there. Behind them is the development and competitiveness of entire industries and the efficiency of the economy. The purpose of this track is to provide knowledge on solving advanced problems related to data analysis and machine learning. The program is based on materials and courses of the Yandex School of Data Analysis and work on projects that are based on current problems faced by partner companies in research and production tasks.

The program is suitable for people who want to learn a new profession and immediately start working in the field of machine learning and data analysis in one of the partner companies of the Sirius Research Center. During the program, participants can finish their studies at a university or work somewhere: it is designed for 6 months and includes full-time and part-time stages. You will need to come to Sochi once, but most of the classes will be held remotely.

Teachers and mentors will be employees of leading universities of the country, including teachers of the School of Data Analysis, as well as experts from partner companies: LLC "OCRV", Tinkoff and Yandex. The program includes individual and team work.

## Program goals:

The program is aimed at mastering specialized areas of training and working methods in the field of digitalization and automation of data processing processes.

**Main objectives of the educational module**:
- study of the application of machine learning methods for solving classification, clustering, regression and ranking problems;
- study of the theoretical foundations of machine learning methods and algorithms;
- practical implementation of machine learning methods for solving applied problems;
- practical implementation of the methods of experimental verification of hypotheses;
- mastering the skills of working in a team, completing a project to create an application based on data analysis and processing.

**Main objectives of the program**:
- analysis of machine learning algorithms, study of the field of applicability and methods for configuring training parameters;
- study of the methodology of data collection for effective analysis and obtaining the resulting model, study of methods of feature selection;
- introduction to a set of relevant and illustrative methods presented in various software libraries and complexes for solving machine learning problems;
- development of logical thinking and formation of knowledge and skills in the field of mathematical models;
- improvement of methods for solving applied problems, justifying the criteria for changes and comparison of methods.;
- research of the obtained mathematical models of specific tasks in the field of professional activity;
- development of skills of joint work on the project and practical skills of decomposition of tasks, use of systems of joint work with data and program code, documentation.

The result of the training program will be the acquisition of additional competencies in the field of analytics and the creation of practical solutions using modern technologies. As part of the work on the project, additional experience will be gained in team work on the development stages of software modules using data flows and machine learning.

The main form of summing up to determine the level of development of the program is the performance of tasks in the remote study of theoretical material and the defense of the project.

As a result of the project defense, students who have demonstrated the best results will be invited to internships in partner companies.

The acquired skills of using tools for the collective execution of tasks and experience in using modern data processing methods should significantly increase the chance to take significant positions in the development of software solutions based on artificial intelligence technologies.

The form of training is full-time and part-time. At the correspondence stage, students study the materials of distance courses. In the framework of the full-time stage: project implementation in teams, preparation of a presentation with the results, project defense.

**Terms and duration of the educational module.**
February 26 – July 25, 2021.
From February 1 to 7, 2021-an online test with solving problems in mathematics and programming (48 hours are given to pass the test from the start).
