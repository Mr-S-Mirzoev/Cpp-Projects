## Form of organizing the selection of participants

Entrance tests are held in two stages: a test task and an interview. Participants who have successfully completed the test task are invited to the interview.

### Test task

As part of the test task, two types of tasks are checked:
- Knowledge in the required mathematical disciplines (mathematical analysis, linear algebra, combinatorics, probability theory, mathematical statistics).
- Programming skills in high-level languages using efficient data structures and algorithms.
