# Lab work to train virtuality knowledge and to revise Vector and ForwardList implementation.

Compile as:

    g++ -o lab main.cpp -std=c++17

This is the solution for version 7 of Rules, stated in rules.pdf. The goal was to make ATD classes:

- Linked list (a.k.a. forward_list)
- DynamicArray (a.k.a. vector)
- Sequence
    - ListSequence
    - ArraySequence
- Triangle_Matrix
