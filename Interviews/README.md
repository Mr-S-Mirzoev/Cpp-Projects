# Interviews

In this folder, you will find a collection of interview questions that I have encountered over the years. They are divided by years and quarters. Each question is organized into a folder that contains the following files:

- `README.md`: a description of the problem and constraints.

- My solution to the problem. May have different names depending on task

- Tests for the solution. May have different names. Usually were added by me to test my solution, but sometimes were provided by the interviewer. In the former case, they were usually written way after the interview, so they may not be complete.

## Copyrigth notice

All solutions are my own, unless otherwise stated. Feel free to use them for inspiration, but please do not copy them directly. I am not responsible for any consequences that may arise from using these solutions.

All the companies and interviewers are *sufficiently* anonymized. If you are an interviewer and would like to be credited or further anonymized, please let me know.
